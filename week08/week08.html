             <div><h3>I. The Burial of the Dead</h3>

<p>April is the cruellest month, breeding<br>
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing<br>
Memory and desire, stirrin<br>
Dull roots with spring rain.<br>
Winter kept us warm, covering<br>
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding<br>
A little life with dried tubers.<br>
Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee<br>
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,<br>
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,<br>
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.<br>
Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.<br>
And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke’s,<br>
My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,<br>
And I was frightened. He said, Marie,<br>
Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.<br>
In the mountains, there you feel free.<br>
I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.<br>

<br><br>


  What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow<br>
Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,<br>
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only<br>
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,<br>
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,<br>
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only<br>
There is shadow under this red rock,<br>
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),<br>
And I will show you something different from either<br>
Your shadow at morning striding behind you<br>
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;<br>
I will show you fear in a handful of dust.<br><br>
                      Frisch weht der Wind
                      Der Heimat zu
                      Mein Irisch Kind,
                      Wo weilest du?<br><br>
“You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;<br>
“They called me the hyacinth girl.<br>
—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden, <br>
Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not<br>
Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither<br>
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,<br>
Looking into the heart of light, the silence.<br>
Oed’ und leer das Meer.<br><br>

  Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,<br>
Had a bad cold, nevertheless<br>
Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,<br>
With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,<br>
Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,<br>
(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)<br>
Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,<br>
The lady of situations.<br>
Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,<br>
And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,<br>
Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,<br>
Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find<br>
The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.<br>
I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.<br>
Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,<br>
Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:<br>
One must be so careful these days.<br><br>

  Unreal City,<br>
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,<br>
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,<br>
I had not thought death had undone so many.<br>
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,<br>
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.<br>
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,<br>
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours<br>
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.<br>
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: “Stetson!<br>
“You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!<br>
“That corpse you planted last year in your garden,<br>
“Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?<br>
“Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?<br>
“Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,<br>
“Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again!<br>
“You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”<br><br></p></div>


              <div><h3>II. A Game of Chess</h3>

<p>The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne, <br>
Glowed on the marble, where the glass<br>
Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines<br>
From which a golden Cupidon peeped out<br>
(Another hid his eyes behind his wing)<br>
Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra<br>
Reflecting light upon the table as<br>
The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,<br>
From satin cases poured in rich profusion;<br>
In vials of ivory and coloured glass<br>
Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,<br>
Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused<br>
And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air<br>
That freshened from the window, these ascended<br>
In fattening the prolonged candle-flames,<br>
Flung their smoke into the laquearia,<br>
Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.<br>
Huge sea-wood fed with copper<br>
Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,<br>
In which sad light a carvéd dolphin swam.<br>
Above the antique mantel was displayed<br>
As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene<br>
The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king<br>
So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale<br>
Filled all the desert with inviolable voice<br>
And still she cried, and still the world pursues,<br>
“Jug Jug” to dirty ears.<br>
And other withered stumps of time<br>
Were told upon the walls; staring forms<br>
Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.<br>
Footsteps shuffled on the stair.<br>
Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair<br>
Spread out in fiery points<br>
Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.<br><br>

  “My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me.<br>
“Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak.<br>
  “What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?<br>
“I never know what you are thinking. Think.”<br><br>

  I think we are in rats’ alley<br>
Where the dead men lost their bones.<br><br>

  “What is that noise?”<br>
                          The wind under the door.<br>
“What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?”<br>
                           Nothing again nothing.<br>
                                                        “Do<br>
“You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember<br>
“Nothing?”<br><br>

       I remember<br>
Those are pearls that were his eyes.<br>
“Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?”<br>
          
                                                                           But
O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag—<br>
It’s so elegant<br>
So intelligent<br>
“What shall I do now? What shall I do?”<br>
“I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street<br>
“With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow?<br>
“What shall we ever do?”<br>
                                               The hot water at ten.<br>
And if it rains, a closed car at four.<br>
And we shall play a game of chess,<br>
Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.<br><br>

  When Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said—<br>
I didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself,<br>
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME<br>
Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.<br>
He’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you<br>
To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.<br>
You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,<br>
He said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you.<br>
And no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert,<br>
He’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time,<br>
And if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said.<br>
Oh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said.<br>
Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.<br>
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME<br>
If you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said.<br>
Others can pick and choose if you can’t.<br>
But if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling.<br>
You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.<br>
(And her only thirty-one.)<br>
I can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face,<br>
It’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.<br>
(She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.)<br>
The chemist said it would be all right, but I’ve never been the same.<br>
You are a proper fool, I said.<br>
Well, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said,<br><br>
What you get married for if you don’t want children?<br>
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME<br>
Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,<br>
And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—<br>
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME<br>
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME<br>
Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.<br>
Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight.<br>
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.</p><br></div>

              <div><h3>III. The Fire Sermon</h3>

  <p>The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf<br>
Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind<br>
Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.<br>
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br>
The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,<br>
Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends<br>
Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.<br>
And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;<br>
Departed, have left no addresses.<br>
By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . .<br>
Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,<br>
Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.<br>
But at my back in a cold blast I hear<br>
The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.<br><br>

A rat crept softly through the vegetation<br>
Dragging its slimy belly on the bank<br>
While I was fishing in the dull canal<br>
On a winter evening round behind the gashouse<br>
Musing upon the king my brother’s wreck<br>
And on the king my father’s death before him.<br>
White bodies naked on the low damp ground<br>
And bones cast in a little low dry garret,<br>
Rattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year.<br>
But at my back from time to time I hear<br>
The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring<br>
Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.<br>
O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter<br>
And on her daughter<br>
They wash their feet in soda water<br>
Et O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole!<br><br>

Twit twit twit<br>
Jug jug jug jug jug jug<br>
So rudely forc’d.<br>
Tereu<br><br>

Unreal City<br>
Under the brown fog of a winter noon<br>
Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant<br>
Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants<br>
C.i.f. London: documents at sight,<br>
Asked me in demotic French<br>
To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel<br>
Followed by a weekend at the Metropole.<br><br>

At the violet hour, when the eyes and back<br>
Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits<br>
Like a taxi throbbing waiting,<br>
I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,<br>
Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see<br>
At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives<br>
Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,<br>
The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights<br>
Her stove, and lays out food in tins.<br>
Out of the window perilously spread<br>
Her drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays,<br>
On the divan are piled (at night her bed)<br>
Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.<br>
I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs<br>
Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest—<br>
I too awaited the expected guest.<br>
He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,<br>
A small house agent’s clerk, with one bold stare,<br>
One of the low on whom assurance sits<br>
As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.<br>
The time is now propitious, as he guesses,<br>
The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,<br>
Endeavours to engage her in caresses<br>
Which still are unreproved, if undesired.<br>
Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;<br>
Exploring hands encounter no defence;<br>
His vanity requires no response,<br>
And makes a welcome of indifference.<br>
(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all<br>
Enacted on this same divan or bed;<br>
I who have sat by Thebes below the wall<br>
And walked among the lowest of the dead.)<br>
Bestows one final patronising kiss,<br>
And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . .<br><br>

She turns and looks a moment in the glass,<br>
Hardly aware of her departed lover;<br>
Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:<br>
“Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”<br>
When lovely woman stoops to folly and<br>
Paces about her room again, alone,<br>
She smoothes her hair with automatic hand,<br>
And puts a record on the gramophone.<br><br>

“This music crept by me upon the waters”<br>
And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.<br>
O City city, I can sometimes hear<br>
Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,<br>
The pleasant whining of a mandoline<br>
And a clatter and a chatter from within<br>
Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls<br>
Of Magnus Martyr hold<br>
Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.<br><br>

               The river sweats<br>
               Oil and tar<br>
               The barges drift<br>
               With the turning tide<br>
               Red sails<br>
               Wide<br>
               To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.<br>
               The barges wash<br>
               Drifting logs<br>
               Down Greenwich reach<br>
               Past the Isle of Dogs.<br>

               Elizabeth and Leicester<br>
               Beating oars<br>
               The stern was formed<br>
               A gilded shell<br>
               Red and gold<br>
               The brisk swell<br>
               Rippled both shores<br>
               Southwest wind<br>
               Carried down stream<br>
               The peal of bells<br>
               White towers<br>
                                Weialala leia<br>

“Trams and dusty trees.<br>
Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew<br>
Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees<br>
Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe.”<br>
<br><br>
“My feet are at Moorgate, and my heart<br>
Under my feet. After the event<br>
He wept. He promised a ‘new start.’<br>
I made no comment. What should I resent?”<br>
<br><br>
“On Margate Sands.<br>
I can connect<br>
Nothing with nothing.<br>
The broken fingernails of dirty hands.<br>
My people humble people who expect<br>
Nothing.”<br>
                       la la<br>

To Carthage then I came<br>
<br><br>
Burning burning burning burning<br>
O Lord Thou pluckest me out<br><br>
O Lord Thou pluckest<br>

              <div><h3>IV. Death by Water</h3>

<p>Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,<br>
Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell<br>
And the profit and loss.<br><br>
                                   A current under sea<br>
Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell<br>
He passed the stages of his age and youth<br>
Entering the whirlpool.<br><br>
                                   Gentile or Jew<br>
O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,<br>
Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.</p></div>


              <div><h3>V. What the Thunder Said</h3>

<p>  After the torchlight red on sweaty faces<br>
After the frosty silence in the gardens<br>
After the agony in stony places<br>
The shouting and the crying<br>
Prison and palace and reverberation<br>
Of thunder of spring over distant mountains<br>
He who was living is now dead<br>
We who were living are now dying<br>
With a little patience<br>
<br><br>
Here is no water but only rock<br><br>
Rock and no water and the sandy road<br>
The road winding above among the mountains<br>
Which are mountains of rock without water<br>
If there were water we should stop and drink<br>
Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think<br>
Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand<br>
If there were only water amongst the rock<br>
Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit<br>
Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit<br>
There is not even silence in the mountains<br>
But dry sterile thunder without rain<br>
There is not even solitude in the mountains<br>
But red sullen faces sneer and snarl<br>
From doors of mudcracked houses<br>
                                      If there were water<br>
   And no rock<br>
   If there were rock<br>
   And also water<br>
   And water<br>
   A spring<br>
   A pool among the rock<br>
   If there were the sound of water only<br>
   Not the cicada<br>
   And dry grass singing<br>
   But sound of water over a rock<br>
   Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees<br>
   Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop<br>
   But there is no water<br>
<br><br>
Who is the third who walks always beside you?<br>
When I count, there are only you and I together<br>
But when I look ahead up the white road<br>
There is always another one walking beside you<br>
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded<br>
I do not know whether a man or a woman<br>
—But who is that on the other side of you?<br>
<br><br>
What is that sound high in the air<br>
Murmur of maternal lamentation<br>
Who are those hooded hordes swarming<br>
Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth<br>
Ringed by the flat horizon only<br>
What is the city over the mountains<br>
Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air<br>
Falling towers<br>
Jerusalem Athens Alexandria<br>
Vienna London<br>
Unreal<br>
<br><br>
A woman drew her long black hair out tight<br>
And fiddled whisper music on those strings<br>
And bats with baby faces in the violet light<br>
Whistled, and beat their wings<br>
And crawled head downward down a blackened wall<br>
And upside down in air were towers<br>
Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours<br>
And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.<br>
<br><br>
In this decayed hole among the mountains<br>
In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing<br>
Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel<br>
There is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home.<br>
It has no windows, and the door swings,<br>
Dry bones can harm no one.<br>
Only a cock stood on the rooftree<br>
Co co rico co co rico<br>
In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust<br>
Bringing rain<br>
<br><br>
Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves<br>
Waited for rain, while the black clouds<br>
Gathered far distant, over Himavant.<br>
The jungle crouched, humped in silence.<br>
Then spoke the thunder<br>
DA<br>
Datta: what have we given?<br>
My friend, blood shaking my heart<br>
The awful daring of a moment’s surrender<br>
Which an age of prudence can never retract<br>
By this, and this only, we have existed<br>
Which is not to be found in our obituaries<br>
Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider<br>
Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor<br>
In our empty rooms<br>
DA<br>
Dayadhvam: I have heard the key<br>
Turn in the door once and turn once only<br>
We think of the key, each in his prison<br>
Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison<br>
Only at nightfall, aethereal rumours<br>
Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus<br>
DA<br>
Damyata: The boat responded<br>
Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar<br>
The sea was calm, your heart would have responded<br>
Gaily, when invited, beating obedient<br>
To controlling hands<br>
 <br><br>
                                    I sat upon the shore<br>
Fishing, with the arid plain behind me<br>
Shall I at least set my lands in order?<br>
London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down<br>
Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina<br>
Quando fiam uti chelidon—O swallow swallow<br>
Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie<br>
These fragments I have shored against my ruins<br>
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe.<br>
Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.<br>
                  Shantih     shantih     shantih</p></div>
