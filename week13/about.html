<p>

  i created this archive as part of the final project for medp250: web production i, as part of my hunter college media studies major.

  <br><br>confined to solely my house during the 2020 covid-19 pandemic, i sought to break down the many parts that make up the idea of "home" and showcase said parts on this site.

  <br><br>through this exercise, i discovered parts and angles of my house i'd never noticed or given second thought to before. i hope this archive makes visitors reflect more deeply on the many parts that make up their own personal spaces, especially during this time.
